This is a free-of-charge, self-paced course comprising six units, designed to empower you to understand how meanings relate systematically to different aspects of grammar and shows how this deeper understanding can be applied to make everyday communication more effective, especially to the students. Successful completion of the course will enable you to:

* understand that grammar can be seen as a flexible and useful tool for meaning making.
* understand how grammar and vocabulary choices together create a range of different meanings.
* see how an awareness of grammar as a tool for meaning-making can be applied to a range of real world situations in everyday life and professional practice.
